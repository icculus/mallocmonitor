# mallocmonitor

This was a project meant to let you track memory allocations in
arbitrary applications.

My thinking was that it would be nice to get a definitive list of
leaks, and maybe a way to visualize memory fragmentation.

But valgrind and other tools made leak tracking possible, and
the transition to 64-bit address spaces made memory
fragmentation largely unimportant, so I never managed to finish
this.

There might be some nuggets of useful code in here, though, so
here it is if someone wants to steal anything.
