- BadBehaviourManager
- Flatten fragmaps to snapshots.
- Rebalance fragmap tree.
- hook up fragmaps to dumpfile parser.
- write Fragmap node/snapshot/manager destruction
- Use native word size, throw error if sizeofptr != sizeof (void *) for now.
- Hook up byteswapping...
- const correctness
- FragMapManager is TOO SLOW...maybe b-trees aren't good for this? Need to
  implement rebalancing and recycling of dead nodes to be sure, though...

// end of TODO ...
