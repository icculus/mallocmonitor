- BadBehaviourManager
- Split fragmap code off into a different file.
- write Fragmap node/snapshot/manager destruction
- const correctness
- Don't use size_t; use, uh, dumpsizet or something.
- compile-time assertions for data type sizes...
- Need a way to turn callstack addresses into file/function/line.
- FragMap snapshots should probably be made by a threshold of time and
  operations, so that a quick blast of allocations doesn't create multiple
  snapshots, and a single allocation over the course of an hour doesn't
  create one, either.
- FragMapManager.get_fragmap() wants a pointer and a reference.
- FragMapManager.get_fragmap() should return a const value.
- FragMapManager.get_fragmap() shouldn't want a dumpfile.
